HI reduction removes oxygen functional groups, and capillary drying promotes layer densification, expected to improve strain to failure, suitable for high-density energy storage materials.","By adding MXene to GO and using capillary drying, investigate the effect of tight layer stacking on strain to failure. Capillary drying induces ordered alignment of GO and MXene layers, enhancing interlayer sliding capacity, expected to increase strain to failure, suitable for high-density energy storage materials.","By studying the strain to failure of pure MXene from a structural perspective, focus on analyzing the influence of its two-dimensional layered structure and surface functional groups. Interlayer sliding and surface functional groups (e.g., -OH, -F) in MXene may lead to strain concentration, expected to result in lower strain to failure. However, optimizing the exfoliation process could improve its flexibility, making it suitable for high-density energy storage materials."]
