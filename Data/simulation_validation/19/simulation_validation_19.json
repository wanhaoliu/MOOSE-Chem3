The introduction of MXene and the basal plane alignment induced by capillary drying are expected to optimize layer stacking, while HI reduction further enhances interlayer interactions, thereby increasing the Young’s modulus and making it suitable for lightweight, high-strength materials.","By adding HI and PSE-AP (1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and 1-aminopyrene) to graphene oxide (GO), test its effect on Young’s modulus. PSE-AP molecules, through π-π bridging, are expected to promote crosslinking between graphene nanosheets, significantly enhancing interlayer bonding strength and increasing the material’s Young’s modulus, making it suitable for high-strength, lightweight structures.","By reducing graphene oxide (GO) with HI, investigate the enhancement of its Young’s modulus. HI, as a strong reducing agent, is expected to effectively remove oxygen-containing functional groups from the GO surface, strengthening the van der Waals forces between graphene layers, thereby increasing the material’s Young’s modulus and making it suitable for lightweight, high-strength applications."]
