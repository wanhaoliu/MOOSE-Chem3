PVA, as a flexible polymer, possesses excellent deformation capacity. The Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ redox pair supports thermoelectric conversion through ion migration and can optimize the crosslinking structure of PVA, thereby enhancing its Young’s modulus. It is expected that by adjusting the PVA crosslinking density, the mechanical strength of the gel can be improved while maintaining its flexibility, making it suitable for body-heat thermoelectric devices.","By combining gelatin with KCl, prepare a flexible gel and investigate its mechanical strength under the influence of the [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻/[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ redox pair. Gelatin provides biocompatibility and a certain level of mechanical strength. KCl, by increasing ionic interactions, may slightly reduce the Young’s modulus of the gel, while the [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻/[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ redox pair supports thermoelectric conversion. It is expected that by optimizing the KCl concentration and gelatin crosslinking degree, the Young’s modulus can be enhanced while maintaining thermoelectric performance, thereby improving the mechanical stability of the gel, making it suitable for body-heat thermoelectric devices.","Investigate the properties of a solution containing [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻/[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ redox pair in a potassium chloride (KCl) solution. The solution properties can be tailored by studying different concentrations to make it suitable for flexible thermoelectric devices."]
