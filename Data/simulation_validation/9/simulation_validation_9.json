The high ionic strength of KCl (0.8 M) will further support ionic conductivity, while the gelatin matrix maintains mechanical stability and flexibility.","By testing a A matrix of gelatin with 0.8 M KCl soaked in a solution of 0.50 M K₄[Fe(CN)₆] and 0.30 M K₃[Fe(CN)₆], and measuring its thermopower under a temperature gradient using copper electrodes (Cu | i-TE | Cu), the flexibility of the gelatin matrix and the high ionic conductivity of KCl will make this system suitable for efficient thermoelectric conversion while maintaining mechanical stability.","By testing a A matrix of gelatin with 0.8 M KCl and measuring its thermopower under a temperature gradient using copper electrodes (Cu | i-TE | Cu), the performance will primarily depend on the ionic conductivity of KCl. The gelatin matrix is expected to provide good mechanical flexibility and biocompatibility, but its thermoelectric performance may be limited due to the absence of redox-mediated charge transfer."]
