Capillary drying promotes tight stacking of GO and MXene, while HI reduction removes oxygen functional groups to strengthen interlayer bonding, expected to enhance tensile strength, suitable for lightweight, high-strength applications.","By reducing GO with HI and adding PSE-AP (1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and 1-aminopyrene), investigate the effect of π-π bridging on tensile strength. HI reduction reduces defects in GO, and PSE-AP enhances layer crosslinking through π-π interactions, expected to improve tensile strength, making it suitable for lightweight, high-strength materials.","By reducing GO with HI, investigate the effect of functional group removal on tensile strength. HI reduction removes oxygen functional groups from the GO surface, enhancing interlayer van der Waals forces, expected to increase tensile strength, suitable for lightweight, high-strength structures.","By testing the tensile strength of pure GO, investigate the influence of its intrinsic structure on mechanical properties. The two-dimensional layered structure of GO and its surface oxygen-containing functional groups provide hydrogen bonding interactions, expected to impart a certain level of tensile strength, suitable for foundational research on lightweight, high-strength materials."]
