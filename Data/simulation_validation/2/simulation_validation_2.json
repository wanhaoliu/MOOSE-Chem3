PVA provides flexibility and transparency, while gelatin enhances the mechanical strength of the gel. The dual-network structure significantly improves the gel’s stretchability through synergistic effects. The presence of the Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ redox pair does not significantly affect the gel’s stretchability, but by optimizing the DMSO/water ratio and crosslinking density, the mechanical stability of the gel during deformation can be further enhanced, making it suitable for long-term use in flexible thermoelectric devices under the temperature difference between body heat and the environment.","By using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a matrix material, prepare a flexible gel and investigate its stretchability under the influence of the [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻/[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ redox pair. PVA provides excellent film-forming ability and flexibility, along with good mechanical strength and chemical stability. The [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻/[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ redox pair supports the thermoelectric conversion function of the gel through its electron transfer properties. The polymer network of PVA may enhance the gel’s stretchability and deformation adaptability through ionic interactions with the redox pair. It is expected that by adjusting the molecular weight or crosslinking degree of PVA, the flexibility and mechanical properties of the gel can be further optimized, making it an ideal candidate material for flexible thermoelectric devices.","By combining gelatin with KCl, prepare a flexible gel and investigate its stretchability under the influence of the [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻/[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ redox pair. Gelatin provides biocompatibility and a certain level of mechanical strength, while KCl optimizes the gel’s stretchability by increasing ionic interactions. The [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻/[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ redox pair supports thermoelectric conversion, and the presence of KCl may further improve the gel’s stretchability by adjusting its internal ionic environment. It is expected that by optimizing the KCl concentration and gelatin crosslinking degree, the gel’s stretchability and deformation recovery ability can be enhanced, making it suitable for flexible thermoelectric devices."]
