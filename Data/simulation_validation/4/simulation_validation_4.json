PVA itself exhibits excellent optical transparency, while the introduction of HCl may affect its transmittance by altering the gel’s crosslinking structure and ionic environment. The Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ redox pair supports thermoelectric conversion, and by optimizing the HCl concentration and PVA crosslinking degree, the scattering effects within the gel can be reduced, thereby enhancing transmittance and making it suitable for optically transparent thermoelectric devices.","By preparing a pure PVA gel, investigate its transmittance under the influence of the Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ redox pair. PVA, as a hydrophilic polymer, possesses excellent optical transparency, and the presence of the Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ redox pair does not significantly affect its transmittance.","By combining gelatin with KCl, prepare a gel and investigate its transmittance under the influence of the [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻/[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ redox pair. The natural properties of gelatin may lead to the presence of scattering centers within the gel, reducing its transmittance, while the introduction of KCl may affect the gel’s transparency by adjusting the ionic environment. The [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻/[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ redox pair supports thermoelectric conversion, and by optimizing the KCl concentration and gelatin crosslinking degree, the scattering effects within the gel can be minimized, thereby enhancing transmittance and making it more suitable for optically transparent thermoelectric applications."]
