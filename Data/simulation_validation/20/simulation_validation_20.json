The introduction of GO and capillary drying are expected to promote ordered stacking of MXene layers, while HI reduction removes oxygen functional groups, strengthening interlayer interactions, thereby increasing the material’s Young’s modulus and making it suitable for lightweight, high-strength applications.","By optimizing the testing of MXene materials’ mechanical properties and measuring their Young’s modulus, we hypothesize that MXene’s layered structure and abundant surface functional groups contribute to its favorable mechanical properties."]
