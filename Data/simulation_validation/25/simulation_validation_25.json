Capillary drying reduces porosity between GO and MXene layers, enhancing interlayer sliding capacity, expected to improve strain to failure, suitable for high-density energy storage materials.","By adding MXene to GO and using confined vacuum processing, investigate the effect of nanoscale confinement-induced basal plane alignment on strain to failure. Confined vacuum processing optimizes the orientation of GO and MXene layers, increasing interlayer sliding space, expected to enhance strain to failure, suitable for high-density energy storage materials.","By studying the strain to failure of pure MXene from a structural perspective, focus on analyzing the influence of its two-dimensional layered structure on flexibility. The single-layer or few-layer structure of MXene exhibits high intrinsic flexibility, and weak interlayer van der Waals forces allow layer sliding, expected to demonstrate high strain to failure, suitable for high-density energy storage materials."]
