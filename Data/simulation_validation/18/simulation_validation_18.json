We hypothesize that HI effectively removes oxygen-containing functional groups from the GO surface, enhancing π-π stacking between graphene layers, while PSE-AP, acting as a π-π bridge, promotes crosslinking between graphene nanosheets. This combined approach is expected to strengthen interlayer bonding, significantly increasing the Young’s modulus of the material and making it suitable for high-density energy storage electrodes."]
