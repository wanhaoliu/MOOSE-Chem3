The oriented structure causes the molecular chains in the gel to align in a specific direction, providing more effective ion conduction channels. This oriented structure helps improve the orderliness of ion migration within the gel, making the thermoelectric effect more significant.","By testing the electrical properties of 9 wt% PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) gel immersed in a 0.4 M Potassium Ferricyanide and Potassium Ferrocyanide(K₃[Fe(CN)₆] / K₄[Fe(CN)₆]) solution with 1 wt% negatively charged silica dispersion Ludox SM-30 through oriented polymerization, we study its thermoelectric effects under temperature gradient. The negatively charged silica particles can further promote the directional migration of ions in the gel by adjusting the electric field distribution within the gel. This optimization of structure and electric field effects can effectively enhance the thermoelectric effect, making the gel generate a larger electromotive force under temperature gradient.","By immersing a 10 wt% PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) gel in a 0.4 M Potassium Ferricyanide and Potassium Ferrocyanide(K₃[Fe(CN)₆] / K₄[Fe(CN)₆]) solution and adding 10 wt% negatively charged silica dispersion Ludox HS-40, the oriented gel exhibits good electrical performance. Negatively charged silica (e.g., Ludox HS-40) has a negative surface charge, which can stabilize the colloid and influence the ionic environment of the solution. After adding 10 wt% Ludox HS-40 dispersion to the PVA matrix, the negatively charged silica particles may affect the ionic conductivity and mechanical properties of the gel through electrostatic interactions.","By preparing a double-network hydrogel consisting of PAMPSNa (2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid sodium salt) and polyacrylamide (PAAm), and then immersing it in a 0.4 M Potassium Ferricyanide and Potassium Ferrocyanide (K₃[Fe(CN)₆] / K₄[Fe(CN)₆]) solution for 24 hours, the thermoelectric performance of the gel is assessed through its electromotive force and maximum output power under a temperature gradient. PAMPSNa, a hydrophilic polymer with sulfonic acid groups, provides high ionic conductivity, while PAAm, with its high water content, contributes good mechanical strength and flexibility, offering robust support for the thermoelectric material. This double-network structure not only imparts excellent mechanical and electrical properties to the gel but also significantly enhances its mechanical and thermal stability, especially during prolonged use.","By preparing polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogel and immersing it in a 0.4 M Potassium Ferricyanide and Potassium Ferrocyanide(K₃[Fe(CN)₆] / K₄[Fe(CN)₆]) solution, the thermoelectric performance of the gel is tested. Polyacrylamide hydrogel, with its high water content and good mechanical flexibility, can provide appropriate support for thermoelectric materials and ensure that they maintain sufficient structural stability under a certain temperature gradient.","By preparing polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogel and immersing it in an aqueous solution, the thermoelectric performance of the gel is tested.
