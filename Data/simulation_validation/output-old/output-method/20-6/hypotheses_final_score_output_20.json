            "###Chemical Key Points###\n1. Graphene Oxide (GO)  \nRole and Function: Graphene oxide serves as an additive that improves the interlayer connections among MXene nanosheets. When GO is added to the MXene system, its oxidized functional groups promote chemical bonding between the surfaces of the MXene and the GO, enhancing the structural integrity and mechanical properties of the composite. The presence of GO contributes to the formation of a more robust network due to its ability to create stronger interactions via covalent and π-π stacking interactions.\n\n2. PSE-AP (1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and 1-aminopyrene)  \nRole and Function: PSE-AP acts as a π-π bridge that facilitates crosslinking between GO nanosheets within the MXene matrix. The pyrene moieties in PSE-AP provide excellent π-π stacking capabilities, thereby enhancing the interaction between adjacent layers of GO. This leads to a denser, more connected structure within the composite material, which is critical for improving mechanical properties such as the Young’s modulus. The N-hydroxysuccinimide ester further allows for reaction with amine functional groups on the surfaces of GO, providing a means for chemical bonding that reinforces the crosslinking.\n\n3. HI Reduction Method  \nRole and Function: The HI reduction method is used to chemically reduce GO after it has been integrated into the MXene structure. This reduction process decreases the oxygen functionalities of GO, thus restoring some of the intrinsic electrical properties of graphene while also maintaining its improved mechanical characteristics through the established crosslinking. The reduction step ensures that the resultant material has enhanced electrical conductivity in addition to increased mechanical stiffness.\n\n4. Capillary Drying Techniques  \nRole and Function: Capillary drying is employed to control the drying process of the GO/MXene composite, promoting the formation of a well-aligned structure with minimized defects. This method enables the preservation of the nanosheet arrangement and enhances the interaction between GO and MXene during drying, which is crucial for maximizing mechanical properties. The careful drying prevents delamination that could detract from the material’s strength.\n\n###End Chemical Key Points###",

            "By adding graphene oxide (GO) to MXene, followed by capillary drying and hydroiodic acid (HI) reduction treatment, investigate the enhancement of its Young’s modulus. The introduction of GO and capillary drying are expected to promote ordered stacking of MXene layers, while HI reduction removes oxygen functional groups, strengthening interlayer interactions, thereby increasing the material’s Young’s modulus and making it suitable for lightweight, high-strength applications.",
            "###Chemical Key Points###\n1. Graphene Oxide (GO)  \nRole and Function: Graphene oxide serves as a reinforcing agent in the MXene matrix. When added to MXene, it promotes an ordered stacking of MXene layers due to its planar structure and ability to form strong π-π interactions with the MXene surfaces. This ordered stacking increases the interaction between layers, which is critical for improving mechanical properties such as Young's modulus. The enhancement in mechanical properties can be attributed to the increased surface area and the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups that facilitate strong adhesive interactions between the GO and MXene layers.\n\n2. Capillary Drying  \nRole and Function: Capillary drying is a method that facilitates the alignment of MXene layers by allowing solvent to evaporate in a controlled manner, promoting the stacking of MXene sheets. This technique minimizes the defects and irregular interlayer spacing that can occur during the drying process. By promoting ordered stacking, capillary drying enhances the mechanical coupling between the MXene layers, which is crucial for obtaining higher stiffness and strength in the resulting composite material.\n\n3. Hydroiodic Acid (HI) Reduction  \nRole and Function: Hydroiodic acid reduction plays a vital role in the functionalization and enhancement of MXene properties. HI effectively removes oxygen-containing functional groups from the MXene surface, which can hinder interlayer interactions. This reduction leads to an increase in the conductivity and strengthening of the interlayer bonding due to the reduced steric hindrance and enhanced van der Waals interactions. The elimination of these functional groups is essential for optimizing the mechanical properties of the composite, especially for applications requiring high strength.\n\n###End Chemical Key Points###",

            "By optimizing the testing of MXene materials’ mechanical properties and measuring their Young’s modulus, we hypothesize that MXene’s layered structure and abundant surface functional groups contribute to its favorable mechanical properties.",
            "###Chemical Key Points###\n1. **MXene Materials**\n   - Role and Function: MXenes are a class of two-dimensional materials derived from the selective etching of MAX phases, characterized by their layered structure. The unique structural features, including their high aspect ratio and metal-dominated surface chemistry, contribute significantly to their mechanical properties. The layered architecture permits delamination and supports shear strength, while the abundant surface functional groups (such as -OH, -O, and -F) enhance interlayer bonding and interactions. This structural complexity enables MXenes to exhibit high Young’s modulus values and superior mechanical resilience, addressing the scientific question regarding their favorable mechanical properties.\n   \n2. **Young’s Modulus**\n   - Role and Function: Young’s modulus is a crucial mechanical property that quantifies the stiffness of a material. By measuring the Young’s modulus of MXenes, the hypothesis also implicates the relationship between the material’s layered structure and its mechanical performance. A high Young’s modulus indicates a material's ability to withstand deformation, and for MXenes, this is likely due to their robust bonding between layers facilitated by surface functionalization. The correlation of measured Young's modulus with the structural attributes of MXenes helps elucidate the mechanisms behind their mechanical robustness.\n\n###End Chemical Key Points###",
