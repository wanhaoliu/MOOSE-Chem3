        "###Chemical Key Points###\n1. **PVA/Gelatin Dual-Network Gel**  \nRole and Function: The PVA/gelatin dual-network gel serves as the foundational polymer matrix that enhances the transmittance properties of the overall material. The combination of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and gelatin creates a synergistic structure that minimizes light scattering due to the reduced presence of defects and scattering centers. This dual-network structure stabilizes the gel and promotes uniformity in composition, which is critical to achieving optical clarity. \n\n2. **DMSO/Water Binary Solvent**  \nRole and Function: The incorporation of a DMSO/water binary solvent is pivotal in modifying the gel's microstructure.

While the primary focus is on optical performance, the presence of these ions can influence the electronic properties of the gel and further enhance its overall performance in thermoelectric applications. The redox reactions can be coupled with the structural attributes provided by the PVA/gelatin matrix and the DMSO/water solvent, potentially leading to improved charge transport capabilities without compromising optical clarity.\n\n###End Chemical Key Points###\n###Results###\nResult 1:  \nThe enhanced optical transparency of the gel material leads to a significant increase in light transmittance, making it suitable for visual applications in flexible thermoelectric devices.
