The introduction of MXene to GO enhances interaction between their surfaces, which contributes to improved mechanical properties by allowing for better load transfer across the material interfaces. This alignment facilitates a more uniform distribution of stress and strains during mechanical loading, thus increasing the overall Young's modulus of the composite material.\n\n2. **Capillary Drying**  \nRole and Function: Capillary drying is a method that aids in aligning the basal planes of GO and MXene, fostering a more ordered structure. During this process, the removal of solvent induces capillary forces that draw the layers closer together in an aligned manner. This alignment maximizes the effective interaction area between the GO and MXene layers, further enhancing the load-bearing capacity and mechanical integrity of the resultant composite, contributing to an increase in Young's modulus.\n\n3. **HI (Hydriodic Acid)**  \nRole and Function: HI acts as a reducing agent in this context. The reduction process aids in improving interlayer interactions by facilitating the removal of oxygen functional groups from GO, which can otherwise interfere with layer adhesion. By decreasing the number of these functional groups, HI helps stabilize the structure of the composite and strengthens the bonding between the graphene oxide and MXene layers, leading to enhanced mechanical properties like increased Young's modulus.\n\n4. **PSE-AP (1-Pyrenebutyric Acid N-Hydroxysuccinimide Ester and 1-Aminopyrene)**  \nRole and Function: PSE-AP serves to reinforce the crosslinking between the GO and MXene structures through covalent bonds and π-π stacking interactions.
