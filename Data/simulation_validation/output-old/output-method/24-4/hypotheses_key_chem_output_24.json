The incorporation of MXene into the GO matrix is expected to modify the mechanical performance of the composite, particularly by enhancing strain to failure.\n\n2. **Graphene Oxide (GO)**\n   Role and Function: Graphene oxide is an oxidized form of graphene that contains various oxygen functional groups, which can significantly impact its mechanical and electrical properties. While GO provides excellent flexibility and mechanical strength, its electrical conductivity is lower compared to reduced graphene oxide or MXenes. In the context of the hypothesis, GO acts as the primary structural matrix where MXenes are integrated, and its oxygen functional groups can initially hinder the conductivity.
