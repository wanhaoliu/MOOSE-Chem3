            "###Chemical Key Points###\n\n1. **Graphene Oxide (GO)**  \n   Role and Function: Graphene oxide (GO) acts as a key component that enhances the mechanical properties of MXene by providing a functionalized surface for interactions. The oxygenated groups on GO (such as epoxide, hydroxyl, and carboxyl groups) facilitate bonding and crosslinking with other components, especially through π-π interactions. The addition of GO to MXene facilitates the creation of stronger interlayer connections, which can increase the overall stiffness and mechanical integrity of the material.\n   \n2. **MXene**  \n   Role and Function: MXene serves as the core material, and the addition of GO improves its mechanical properties. MXene itself provides excellent conductivity and structural characteristics, while the GO nanosheets improve the strength and interlayer bonding through functional group interactions. Together, they enable MXene to have higher mechanical performance, which is crucial for lightweight, high-strength materials.\n\n3. **PSE-AP (1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and 1-aminopyrene)**  \n   Role and Function: PSE-AP acts as a π-π bridge, promoting the crosslinking of GO nanosheets. The pyrene groups in PSE-AP form π-π interactions with the GO nanosheets, leading to enhanced interlayer connections. This crosslinking significantly increases the mechanical strength, especially the Young’s modulus, of the MXene/GO composite. The interaction between PSE-AP and GO also improves the stability and durability of the material, making it suitable for high-strength applications.\n\n4. **Capillary Drying and HI Reduction**  \n   Role and Function: Capillary drying is a method used to remove solvents from the composite, ensuring that the GO and MXene maintain their structural integrity during the drying process. HI reduction further reduces any oxygenated functional groups on MXene and GO, promoting better bonding and the removal of any unstable intermediates that could degrade the material's mechanical properties. These steps help maintain a robust structure and improve the bonding between GO and MXene.\n\n###End Chemical Key Points###",

            "###Chemical Key Points###\n1. Graphene Oxide (GO)  \nRole and Function: Graphene oxide serves as a structural additive that promotes the ordered stacking of MXene layers during the capillary drying process. Its functional groups enhance intermolecular interactions and contribute to a more robust network within the composite material. This added structural integrity is critical for enhancing the Young’s modulus, as the interactions between GO and MXene facilitate load distribution across the layers, resulting in improved mechanical properties.\n\n2. Capillary Drying Method  \nRole and Function: The capillary drying method prompts the controlled evaporation of solvents, allowing for the alignment of MXene layers. This technique enhances the arrangement of the material on a nanoscale, leading to optimal stacking of MXene sheets, which is essential for mechanical strength. An ordered arrangement translates into higher bonding strength between layers, leading to a substantial increase in the Young’s modulus of the composite structure.\n\n3. Hydroiodic Acid (HI) Reduction Treatment  \nRole and Function: Hydroiodic acid is used to reduce graphene oxide and remove the oxygen functional groups that may hinder the interaction between MXene layers. By reducing GO, HI enhances the material properties through deoxygenation, which strengthens the interlayer bonding and cohesion between MXene and GO. The removal of these functional groups increases the overall density of the material and further promotes an increase in Young’s modulus, making the final product stiffer and stronger.\n\n4. MXene  \nRole and Function: MXene serves as the primary structural component in this composite enhancement. Its inherent properties, like high electrical conductivity and mechanical strength, provide a baseline for performance. Upon integration with GO and treatment with HI, the interlayer interactions are significantly improved, allowing for enhanced mechanical properties such as a raised Young's modulus. The ordered arrangement combined with strong interlayer bonding is key to achieving lightweight and high-strength applications.\n\n###End Chemical Key Points###",
