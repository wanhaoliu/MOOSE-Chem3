This is expected to independently increase strain to failure (%), supporting electrochemical energy storage applications.","From a structural perspective, pure MXene, due to its unique two-dimensional layered structure and surface functional groups, exhibits excellent flexibility and strain capacity. By regulating MXeneâ€™s interlayer spacing and surface chemical properties, it is expected to significantly enhance strain to failure (%), making it suitable as an independent high-density energy storage material."]
